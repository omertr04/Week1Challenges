## Description

Welcome to my Horiseon Website! This is a marketing agency website that I created as part of the Week 1 challenge. It showcases the range of services offered by Horiseon, including search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. I have carefully designed this website to provide valuable information about these services and their benefits.

One of the major changes I made was adopting a semantic approach to the website's structure. By using semantic HTML elements, I ensured that the website follows a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. This not only improves the accessibility and search engine optimization of the website but also enhances the overall user experience.

I have also incorporated responsive design principles into the website, making it look great and function properly across various devices and screen sizes. Whether you're viewing it on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, you can expect a consistent and user-friendly experience.
